## Overview

This is my first challenge on devchallenges.io and I'm so excited, because it's a good start for newbies. You're free to check out the demo here: https://404-not-found-demo-page.netlify.app/ o just by clicking the top link "DEMO".

This 404 page not found demo was made with HTML5 and CSS3. First, I structured the page with HTML with three diferent sections inside the main div "container". 

After that just stylish with a few lines of CSS. Mainly by position relative (for parent) and absolute for the elements inside. Also, I've made a media query section for screens up to 375px.

One of the most particular things that I've learned is: you must set up the parent div element with position: "relative". And all child elements could positioned with poisition "absolute".

It's the easiest way  that I find to configure the page's layout.

You could try another layout such as CSS-grid or flex-box mixed. But for me that was the most suitable way for developed this excercise. 

Another cool thing about this excercise was met Figma for first time. It's awesome and really helpul for team-works.

Hope you enjoy it and give me feedback.

My advice:

- Always have activate dev tool for your prefer browser. I use Google Chrome.
- Continuosly check the desgin on Figma to be sure that you're meeting the design requeriments.
- You have to be sure to use the right selectors for apply style.
